>  **Note:** Ignore top-level domain errors, which cannot be fixed by the IdFix tool.

12. In the  **Klemen Sic** row, verify the proposed solution in the **UPDATE** column, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

13. In the  **Lara Raisic** row, verify the proposed solution in the **UPDATE** column, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

14. In the  **Logan Boyle** row, verify the proposed solution in the **UPDATE** column, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**. In the  **Update** column for **Logan Boyle**, type  **Logan@Adatum.com**.

15. In the  **Maj Hojski** row, verify the proposed solution in the **UPDATE** column, and then in the **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

16. On the toolbar, click  **Apply**.

17. In the  **Apply Pending** dialog box, click **Yes**. Notice the  **COMPLETE** status in the **ACTION** column, which indicates successful writes.

19. Switch back to the IdFix tool.

20. On the toolbar, click  **Query**.

21. Click in the  **UPDATE** column to locate the **Maj Hojski** error, replace the string with **maj@adatum.com**, and then in the  **ACTION** column, select **EDIT**.

22. For **An** **Dung** and **Ngoc** **Bich**, select **EDIT** in the **ACTION** column.

23. On the toolbar, click  **Apply**.

24. In the  **Apply Pending** dialog box, click **Yes**.

25. On the toolbar, click  **Query**, and then verify that the errors are corrected. If you see other errors present, correct them using the same method.

26. Close all open windows.


>  **Note:** Where there are format and duplicate errors for distinguished names, the **UPDATE** column either contains the same string as the **VALUE** column, or the **UPDATE** column entry is blank; in either case, this means that IdFix cannot suggest a remediation for the error. You can either fix these errors outside of IdFix or manually remediate them within IdFix. You can also export the results and use Windows PowerShell to remediate a large number of errors.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have troubleshot synchronization issues with user objects in Office 365.
